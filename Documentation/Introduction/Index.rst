.. _what-it-does:

What does it do?
----------------

This extension adds support for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to TYPO3's
Frontend.

It supports TYPO3 v10 LTS, v11 LTS and v12 LTS.

MFA can be configured by editing a ``fe_users`` record in the TYPO3 Backend. A
Frontend plugin is provided to allow users to configure their MFA settings
themselves.

.. note::

   This extension has been initially inspired by
   `[codeFareith] Google Authenticator <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/cf_google_authenticator>`__
   but it has been rewritten and extended as that former extension was not
   actively maintained anymore. Thanks to the original author
   Robin "codeFareith" von den Bergen for the inspiration!

Privacy
-------

This extension does not store any personal data. It only stores the secret used
by the configured MFA method in the ``fe_users`` table (field ``mfa``).

When configuring TOTP, a QR code is generated to let the user configure their
Authenticator app.

When installing this extension via Composer, the following third-party package
is installed and used to generate the QR code **locally**:
`chillerlan/php-qrcode <https://github.com/chillerlan/php-qrcode>`__.

If however you choose to install this extension via the TYPO3 Extension Manager
or manually by downloading the T3X or ZIP file, the QR code is generated by
the deprecated
`Google Chart API <https://developers.google.com/chart/infographics/docs/qr_codes>`__.

This may change in the future, e.g., using the same method as TYPO3 Core but all
methods are marked as "internal" and we prefer to use them as little as possible
at the moment.
